# NLP-analysis
This project comprises three interconnected phases, collectively illuminating the landscape of natural language processing and artificial intelligence. The first phase, "Sentence Classification," scrutinizes text data at a granular level, identifying the presence of sexist content using models such as "bert-base-uncased," "xlbert-large-uncased," and "roberta-large." 
This initial phase sets the stage for the second, "Explainable Algorithm Development," which seeks to demystify the intricate workings of AI models, including "xlbert-large-uncased," in recognizing sexist tokens. 
The final phase, "Target Identification," expands the horizon by pinpointing and elucidating specific targets of sexist comments. Together, these phases endeavor to bolster the transparency and effectiveness of AI models in textual analysis.
